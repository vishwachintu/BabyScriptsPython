# Data to Parquet Converter

This Python script allows you to convert data from various formats into Parquet files, which is an efficient columnar storage format.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library (install using `pip install pandas`)

## Steps:

```
1. Place your data file (e.g., input_data.csv) in the same directory as the script.

2. Open the terminal/command prompt and run the script:

3. python data_to_parquet.py

4. The script will read the data from the input_data.csv file and convert it into a Parquet file named output_data.parquet.

5. Find the converted Parquet file (output_data.parquet) in the same directory.
```
